# LCD_Blink
Using the TFT display in the PIC24EP microcontroller to blink it at 2Hz frequency

The objective of this project is: 

To understand the LCD module available in the PIC24EP512GU810 board and to make the LCD display backlight blink at a frequency of 2Hz.

Configuring the internal and external oscillators was explored in this assignment to change the frequency of the LCD display backlight blinking.

Configuring input clock prescale select bits and how to set them using T1CON (Timer 1 control register) was explored.
